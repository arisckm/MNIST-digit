🧮 MNIST Digit Recognition using CNN

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset.

📌 Project Overview

Implemented a deep learning model (CNN) to classify digits.

Trained and evaluated on the MNIST dataset (70,000 images).

Achieved ~98% accuracy on test data.

Explored different model saving formats (.keras, .h5, TensorFlow SavedModel).
